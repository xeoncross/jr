[enable JavaScript to render MarkDown]: <pre>

# Welcome to Jr!

A static, static content generator that moves the "generator" part to the browser.
This site is pure text files with a single Javascript included on each page that renders
the theme and assets as needed.

Go ahead, take a look at the source code for this page.

	You want my page, fine, you render it! 
	                                   ~ Nginx


You see, there is really no need for the server to generate anything for simple
article-based sites like this. If the user wants to read your blog, they can spend
a few processor cycles to render the page themselves.
