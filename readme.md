# Welcome to Jr!

A static, static content generator that moves the "generator" part to the browser.
This site is pure text files with a single Javascript included on each page that renders
the theme and assets as needed.

Each page is written in markdown with a single `<script>` tag that includes Jr.js. Once you have created your pages then simply upload the system to your website and enjoy.

## [Visit the Demo](http://xeoncross.github.io/jr)

## Getting Started

1. [Download](http://github.com/Xeoncross/Jr) `Jr`
2. Create an `[article-name].html` file
3. Paste the following code at the bottom of the page:  
	<code>&lt;script src=&quot;jr.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>  
4. `git commit` the new article or (sad face) SFTP it up to your web host

...and you're done! Rinse and repeat.
